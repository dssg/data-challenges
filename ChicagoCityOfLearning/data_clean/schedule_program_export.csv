During each of the program sessions teens will work on basic culinary skills and techniques, returning apprentices will have the opportunity to be assigned a lead chef position which will give them the chance to show leadership skills and work on advanced culinary techniques. The apprentices will create a cookbook based on their own original recipes; some of these recipes will be showcased in a closing banquet at the end of each program session for invited family and members of the community. In addition to our current program, we'd like to also be considered to offer the following additional programming: I.

This program will support the younger teens (Freshman and Sophomores) who apply to our program but who may not be mature enough to handle the rigor of our regular apprenticeship.
